# Hungarian-Algorithm-mySQL
Hungarian Algorithm code written as practice. Meant to sort students to jobs, given each student having a "score" of how well they did on the interview for each job.

Maximizes benefit for all companies and students so best possible matching occurs. 

Comments were also made to practice explaining to non-programmers. This code was given to a group that is meant to be able to use the algorithm despite not touching code before. Supplemental videos explaining how to use it were provided
